Hello! Welcome to ClassMate! This is a project made with JavaFX for the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science CS3233 computer science module/course.

Expected functionalities:
1. UML Diagram Generator - Generate UML Diagrams with (more than) one click by uploading a single directory/.cmud file! The UML Diagram can then be edited before being exported to an image file, or a .cmud (ClassMate UML Diagram) file.
2. AI Buddy - Your very own ChatGPT for general coding purposes, powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash!
3. Mindmap Generator _**(UNCONFIRMED)**_ - Generate a mindmap to organise all your budding ideas, with the help of AI!

Please note that as this is currently _**work in progress**_, expected functionalities may not be present/work as expected.
Feel free to expand on this project if you wish!
